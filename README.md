# events-list-with-filters

Single page app with an events list and functional filers. Note: This is only a sample app with a single view. Navigation links are not functional and are for presentation only.
I have included the dist/ bundle in this repo if you would like to skip setup. Just open `index.html`


## Setup
1. [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Clone the repo and `cd` to the cloned directory, then run `npm install`
4. Run `./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.js --watch`

If you run into issues with installation feel free to email me vale@webdynamix.com
