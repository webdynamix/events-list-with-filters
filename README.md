# events-list-with-filters

Single page app with an events list and functional filers.
I have included the dist/ package in this repo if you would like to skip setup. Just open `index.html`

## Setup
1. [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Clone the repo and `cd` to the cloned directory, then run `npm install` or `yarn`
4. Run `./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.js --watch`
